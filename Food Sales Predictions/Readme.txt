Overview: Cleanse and prepare product and outlet data for machine learning modeling. Apply linear regression and decision tree modeling then analyze the variations between predicted sales and actual sales in the test dataset to determine which of the models most accurately predict future sales data.

Data: 8523 records across 12 data columns, contains no duplicate records, and a total of 3873 null values. 545 irregular category names are normalized to the standard naming convention. Sales data is isolated as as the target for prediction and irrelevant identifier and establishment year data is removed as features for modeling. Data is split into training and testing datasets then a pipeline is used to impute null values with average numerical values and most frequent categorical values. As part of the pipeline data is transformed using a scalar and OHE encoder.

Model Testing Results: Linear Regression and Decision Tree results were testing using the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. Linear regression produced low variance and moderately accurate results while decision tree model performed poorly. Linear Regression model can be used to identify opportunities to improve sales however is not accurate enough to be used as a model for forecasting.
